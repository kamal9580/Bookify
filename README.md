# Bookify MERN Project

## Description

This is a full-stack book store application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The application allows signup users to browse books and view details. Admin users can manage books and orders.


## Features

-   User authentication and authorization
-   Browse and search for books
-   View book details
-   Admin dashboard for managing books and orders

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind css
-   **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
-   **Database**: MongoDB
-   **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## How the Tech Works

### Frontend

#### React.js

-   **Component-Based Architecture**: React allows you to build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. This makes your code more predictable and easier to debug.
-   **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render components when data changes. This enhances the performance of your application.

### Backend

#### Node.js

-   **JavaScript Runtime**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server side.


#### Express.js

-   **Web Framework**: Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the development of web servers and APIs by providing a robust set of features.
-   **Middleware**: Express allows you to use middleware to handle requests, responses, and routing. Middleware functions can execute code, modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware function.

### Database

#### MongoDB

-   **NoSQL Database**: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. This makes it easy to store and retrieve hierarchical data.
-   **Schema-less**: Unlike traditional SQL databases, MongoDB does not require a predefined schema, allowing you to have a more flexible and dynamic data model.

### Authentication

#### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

-   **Token-Based Authentication**: JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization.
-   **Stateless**: With JWT, the server does not need to store session information. Instead, the token contains all the necessary information, reducing the server overhead and improving scalability.
